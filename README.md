## Example

Suppose you have a passage about a historical event or scientific concept. QuestionCrafter will analyze the text, identify key nouns and concepts, and construct MCQs based on the extracted information. Each question stem will feature a blank space for the correct answer, surrounded by plausible distractors derived from other relevant content in the text.
